# node-xiaomi-smart-home

**!! Please note - this module is no longer maintained !!**

I recommend [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) as the platform for integration. Works really well.



----

Node.js module for [Xiaomi smart home](http://xiaomi-mi.com/smart-home/xiaomi-mi-smart-home-kit/) (also branded as Aquara)
  
Use this module to get data from Xiaomi sensors - temperature/humidity, magnet switch, button (switch), motion sensor

Note that you need to switch on the developer mode - [HOWTO](http://bbs.xiaomi.cn/t-13198850). The link is in Chinese, but good enough with google translate and screenshots.
